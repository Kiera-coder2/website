<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Courier;"> Hello! My name is Kiera Anne L. Amor. I am from 9-Fidelity, and our adviser is Dr. Dureza D. Dancal. <br><br>
I think I know myself pretty well, maybe or maybe not. I have yet to experience life fully,<br><br>
and Im not mature enough to make big desicions on my own. I know that much since I still rely on people,<br><br> 
I rely on my friends, I rely on my parents, I even rely to social media. It's bad I know, I trust them more than I trust myself. <br><br>
I don't think of myself as a bad person though. I think Im nice, kind and lovable. Im approached by many people I have a lot of friends.<br><br>
And I would like to say that Im successful in school, except for a few subjects. My hobbies? I don't have a lot, <br><br>
but i do like to draw, paint, sketch, sing and sometimes sing. Im the oldest and I have one sibling that is 10 years old.<br><br>
He's smart, and im sure he will follow on my footsteps on becoming an Lpsci student. I have nice parents they treat me well,<br><br>
but sometimes they get mad with my scores, maybe they expect to much from me since I was the previous valedictorian in my school.<br><br>
Im not really that amazing and I don't know how to make them realize that. That is all about me, im just a simple person, nothing more, nothing less. <br><br>
Im an average kid who's trying to her best in school to make friends and survive.
